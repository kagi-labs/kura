# Project Kura 🏯
**The Definitive Agentic Datastore.**

Kura is a local-first storage abstraction layer for AI agents. It provides a unified S3-compatible interface and MCP server for persistent memory, artifacts, and cross-session data, while handling complex syncing (S3, GDrive) transparently in the background.

## Core Mission
To eliminate "sync hacks" by providing agents with a reliable, high-performance binary that manages local and remote state.

## Key Features
- **MCP Native:** Direct integration with Model Context Protocol.
- **S3 Interface:** Speak the standard language of the cloud, locally.
- **Local-First:** High-speed writes to local SSD.
- **Background Sync:** Reliable adapters for Google Drive, S3, and more.
